# Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

## Module Summary

This document contains test cases created using the Boundary Value Analysis technique to validate the username field limits in the registration form.

The tests verify how the system behaves when values are inserted at the minimum and maximum boundaries of the allowed input range.

## Business Rules

BR-BVA-01: The system must enforce the minimum character limit for the username field.

BR-BVA-02: The system must enforce the maximum character limit for the username field.

BR-BVA-03: The system must allow usernames that fall within the valid character range.

## Field Information

Field: Username

Minimum allowed length: 6 characters  
Maximum allowed length: 30 characters
